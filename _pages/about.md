Le Chen is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, supervised by [Dr. Rajeev Thakur](https://web.cels.anl.gov/~thakur/).
His research spans **HPC4AI** ↔ **AI4HPC**.
In HPC4AI, he focuses on large-scale and efficient inference and training of AI models on modern supercomputing systems. In AI4HPC, his work centers on developing and evaluating large language models (LLMs) for scientific code generation, translation, and reasoning. Broadly, his research aims to bridge high-performance computing and artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery.
